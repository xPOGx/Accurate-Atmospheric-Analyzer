# Overview
**Accurate Atmospheric Analyzer** (AAA) is a mobile application designed to provide users with comprehensive and reliable weather information in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

The AAA project aims to create a robust and feature-rich weather application. The app will offer:

- Real-time weather data
- Offline capabilities
- Customizable themes
- In-depth weather analytics
- User-friendly interface


## Key Features

- **Offline-first:** The app will continue to function even without an internet connection, thanks to local data caching using Jetpack Room.
- **Real-time updates:** The app will fetch new weather data every hour to ensure accuracy.
- **MVI architecture:** This architecture will be implemented to manage the app's state and side effects effectively.
- **Data persistence:** The app will use ProtoDataStore to store non-persistent data.
- **Clean architecture:** The app will be structured into three layers: presentation, data, and domain for better maintainability.
- **Firebase integration:** Firebase will be used for analytics and potentially other features like cloud messaging.
- **Custom UI components:** A custom UV Index view will be created using View.
- **Accessibility:** The app will provide a multi-theme feature to cater to user preferences.

## Technical Stack

- **Kotlin:** As the primary programming language
- **Jetpack Compose:** For building the UI
- **Jetpack Room:** For local data storage
- **Ktor:** For network requests
- **Kotlin Serialization:** For JSON serialization
- **Coroutines:** For asynchronous programming
- **Firebase:** For analytics and potentially other features

### Target Audience

This application is ideal for anyone who wants to stay informed about the weather, including:

- People who spend a lot of time outdoors
- Travelers
- Farmers and gardeners
- Anyone who needs to plan their day or week around the weather
- Andrii Malitchuk

#### Additional Notes

- **Security:** Sensitive information like API keys should be stored securely using Gradle secrets.
- **Error handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging using CoroutineExceptionHandler and Crashlytics.
- **Performance:** Optimize the app for performance by minimizing network requests and using efficient data structures.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities.
